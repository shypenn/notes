REST(REpresentational Stateless Transfer)
@) Use HTTP methods conformingly(do what the method defines).
 *) safe methods(retrieval: GET/HEAD) should not take other actions more significant;
 *) idempotent methods(GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE) take constant side effects no matter how many times it executes continually;
 	.) OPTIONS/TRACE should not have side effects; 
 	.) a sequence of different idempotent methods can be not idempotent;

@) Use HTTP methods explicitly.
	*)To create a resource on the server, use POST.
	*)To retrieve a resource, use GET.
	*)To change the state of a resource or to update it, use PUT.
	*)To remove or delete a resource, use DELETE.
Be stateless.
Expose directory structure-like URIs.
Transfer XML, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), or both.
