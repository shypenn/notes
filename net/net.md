## Terms

* IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force): who  develops and promotes voluntary Internet Standards, e.g.  Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP);
* RFC (Request for Comments): internet standard;
* octet: binary octet, 8 bits, one byte.

## Acronyms:

* NCB		--	network control block
* MSL		--	maximum segment lifetime
* WSAStartup	--	Windows Socket Application
* MAC: media access control;

## Commands:

* URG:  Urgent Pointer field significant
* ACK:  Acknowledgment field significant
* PSH:  Push Function
* RST:  Reset the connection
* SYN:  Synchronize sequence numbers
* FIN:  No more data from sender

## TCP Status:

* LISTEN - represents waiting for a connection request from any remote TCP and port.

* SYN-SENT - represents waiting for a matching connection request after having sent a connection request.

* SYN-RECEIVED - represents waiting for a confirming connection request acknowledgment after having both received and sent a connection request.

* ESTABLISHED - represents an open connection, data received can be delivered to the user.  The normal state for the data transfer phase of the connection.

* FIN-WAIT-1 - represents waiting for a connection termination request from the remote TCP, or an acknowledgment of the connection termination request previously sent.

* FIN-WAIT-2 - represents waiting for a connection termination request from the remote TCP.

* CLOSE-WAIT - represents waiting for a connection termination request from the local user.

* CLOSING - represents waiting for a connection termination request acknowledgment from the remote TCP.

* LAST-ACK - represents waiting for an acknowledgment of the connection termination request previously sent to the remote TCP (which includes an acknowledgment of its connection termination request).

* TIME-WAIT - represents waiting for enough time to pass to be sure the remote TCP received the acknowledgment of its connection termination request.

* CLOSED - represents no connection state at all.

## Three way handshake

1. A --> B  SYN my sequence number is X
2. A <-- B  ACK your sequence number is X;
			SYN my sequence number is Y
3. A --> B  ACK your sequence number is Y   


## http2/SPDY

* push data that client didn't request;
* most client only support in https;
* header compression
* stream priority;
* multiplex streams in a single connection;

 
## stateless
requires no context data is stored, instead passing as parameters;

## http pipleline 

**asyn requests, sync responses**

doesn't wait the previous request got response(responses still are ordered by requests got);

	> don't apply to non-idempotent requests such as 'post';


## URI (URL+URN)
```
         foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
         \_/ \________________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
          |           |            |            |        |

         urn:example:animal:ferret:nose
```
* scheme ` ALPHA  DIGIT  "+"  "-"  "." `

* authority ` // [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ] [ / | ? | # ]`

* userinfo ` unreserved pct-encoded sub-delims ":" `

* host ` IP-literal IPv4address reg-name `

* scheme & path are required. **path can be empty**

* reserved chars (delimiters);

	* gen-delims  = `:  /  ?  #  [  ]  @`

	* sub-delims  = `!  $  &  '  (  ) *  +  ,  ;  =`

	>encodeURI() only percent-encode `[]` in above delims;
	>
	>encodeURIComponent() percent-encode all but `!'()*`;

* unreserved chars (no special meaning, no need to percent-encoding);

	`ALPHA  DIGIT  -  .  _  ~`

* unicode in host name is converted to `Punycode` in most browsers.

	whatever unicode chars are extracted and appended with their encoding number: 
	
	`xn--<ascii>-<unicode>`

	`www.abäººcde.org`	=>	`www.xn--abcde-dd2h.org`


## IP address

dword, 4-bytes, can be any form of:

* any 4 numbers of combination of decimal/hex/octet together separated by dot

	123.125.114.144

	123.0x7d.114.0220

* any leading bytes till all four can be coalesced together:

	123.0x7d.29328

	2071818896


## socks5
* It resides between transport and application layers.
* So it adopts **TCP** to negotiate and **TCP/UDP** to transport.
* It's invoked directly by application.

## TLS

### format

```
  struct {
      uint8 major;
